				<h2 class="post-title">AI Tinkerers Meetup in Japan</h2>
				<div class="post-date">January 2026</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt">
					I had the opportunity to participate in the AI Tinkerers meetup in Japan 2 weeks ago. It was not only a great chance to network with many talented developers, but also an amazing learning experience.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					My favorite takeaways were:
				</p>
				<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--color-accent);">
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">Offline AI agents for disaster response</h3>
					<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
						One project showcased an AI agent that does not require an internet connection. Its purpose is to support people with survival-related questions. For example, you could ask, “A tsunami is coming—what should I do?” This kind of tool could be extremely valuable after a disaster, especially when internet access is unavailable.
					</p>
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">Lesser-known Claude features</h3>
					<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
						I also learned about some Claude functionalities I wasn’t aware of before. For instance, the /context command on the terminal allows you to view the system prompt, messages, system tool usage, and more. This helps you understand how many tokens are allocated to the system. If there isn’t enough available token space, Claude’s output quality may suffer.

		<div class="blog-post" id="ai-summit">
				<h2 class="post-title">AI Engineering Code Summit</h2>
				<div class="post-date">November 2025</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt">
					I had the privilege of volunteering at and attending the AI Engineering Code Summit in NYC. I was fortunate to connect with so many talented individuals, including Giedrius Žebrauskas and Sahil Kadadekar 🦀 who offered solid advice on how to stand out in today's highly competitive job market for CS undergraduates.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					My favorite workshops and talks included:
				</p>
				<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--color-accent);">
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">1: How to Stand Out in the Current Job Market</h3>
					<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
						One key takeaway was the importance of showcasing your personal projects. If you're building something, share weekly updates on LinkedIn. Talk about what you struggled with and how you solved it. Over time, someone interested in your work may reach out with an opportunity.
					</p>
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">2: Google Antigravity</h3>
					<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
						This presentation was especially fascinating. The tool can automatically open a new window and begin testing your website in real time. It not only runs tests but also visualizes the entire process—you can literally watch Antigravity click buttons and type into text fields as it evaluates your UI.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					Overall, this summit showed me just how quickly technology is advancing. It also reignited my motivation to keep developing my project and deepen my experience with new tools and frameworks.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					I'm heading into finals with renewed energy and inspiration.

				<h2 class="post-title">My Tech Week Update #5</h2>
				<div class="post-date">October 2025</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt">
					Hello everyone,
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					It's hard to believe it's already been a month since the new semester began. This term, my academic focus is on Discrete Mathematics, Elementary Differential Equations, and Software Engineering.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					My primary goal is to effectively manage my time between these demanding courses, my involvement in clubs, and my passion for web interface development. On AI Fighting game coach, I'm currently focused on enhancing my website's reliability. The goal is to implement an UptimeRobot that interfaces with Langflow to ensure the site remains consistently active.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					While my academic schedule requires my full attention, I am still committed to my personal projects. Updates to my website and the Fighting Game Coach project may be more gradual this semester, but I will continue to make steady progress.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					Thank you for following my journey.

				<h2 class="post-title">My Tech Week Update #4</h2>
				<div class="post-date">August 2025</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt">
					Hello everyone,
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					I've been in Japan for two weeks now, and it's nice to be back home seeing my friends.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					Now for my tech update:
				</p>
				<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--color-accent);">
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">Here's what I learned:</h3>
					<ul style="color: var(--color-text); line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; list-style-type: '・';">
						<li>I recently attended Google Cloud Next '25 Tokyo and visited the Google for Startups Campus. It was not only a fantastic opportunity to network and learn from other companies, but it also greatly boosted my confidence in my skill set. I was pleasantly surprised by how interested people were in my background, which gave me the assurance that the work I've been doing is valuable.</li>
						<li>My Fighting Game Coach is starting to come together. The website is deployed and functional. However, the local and network versions of Langflow work very differently, so I had to create a new AI agent setup specifically for the network version.</li>
						<li>My father suggested using a container to manage my website environment. A container basically keeps everything in one place, making deployment and maintenance easier. This time, I'm using Podman.</li>
						<li>I made a crucial mistake during the project: I used uppercase letters in some filenames. It might seem minor, but when merging branches on GitHub, it caused conflicts that were a hassle to fix. When my father showed me how containers work, I had to reorganize a lot of my files and paths.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					The biggest lesson I learned this week: always keep your filenames lowercase. It'll save you a lot of trouble later on.
				</p>

					I hope everyone had a nice 4th of July.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					I've been working on my AI Fighting Game Coach recently, and here's what I learned.

				<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--color-accent);">
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">Here's what I learned:</h3>
					<ul style="color: var(--color-text); line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; list-style-type: '・';">
						<li>I built my website for AI Fighting Game Coach on Render last week. However, I had some security issues like hiding my API keys from Langflow. Also, I wanted to add some monitoring function on my website to make sure my website is running without errors all the time.</li>
						<li>Here's what I did to solve my problems: I decided to not only use environment variables to protect my API keys but also decided to build server and client side of my website. For monitoring, I visited Google's tech talk a week and a half ago. I learned multiple products that would be a good fit for my project, and it was great to network with people.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					Overall, the project has been published, but has some issues with the Langflow. This week, I'm planning to wrap up my project and come up with future upgrades.

				<h2 class="post-title">My Tech Week Update #2</h2>
				<div class="post-date">June 2025</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt">
					Hello again!
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					This week, I designed a website platform for my AI-powered fighting game coach. It was my first time integrating AI into a website, which was both exciting and challenging. My biggest struggle was connecting the frontend of the website with Langflow. Although I had set up the API connection, I couldn't parse the AI's responses correctly.
				</p>
				 <p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					What helped me overcome this issue was a live-streaming session by the Langflow team. It not only helped me fix the bug but also sparked new ideas for my project. You can <a href="https://app.sequel.io/event/c42128eb-c59d-46f7-b3cd-ad2cf5fb1fab?joinCode=Gvwixrtcx1QF" target="_blank" style="color: var(--color-accent); text-decoration: none;">watch the session here</a>.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					Additionally, I learned how to embed videos from DeepLearning.AI. Multimodal embeddings are an interesting topic and could be beneficial for my project.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					I'm excited to continue learning and improving my project, with the goal of turning it into a full-fledged product.

					<h2 class="post-title">Tech Week 1 Update</h2>
				</a>
				<div class="post-date">May 2025</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt">
					Hi everyone! This past Tech Week, I had the chance to attend several events. While I started off feeling anxious about diving into unfamiliar topics, I ended up having a great time learning about AI agents and generative AI through tech talks and a hackathon.
				</p>
				<div style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--color-accent);">
					<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; color: var(--color-text);">Here's what I learned:</h3>
					<ul style="color: var(--color-text); line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 1rem; padding-left: 1rem; list-style-type: '・';">
						<li>One of the biggest challenges I faced was understanding AI agents, since I didn't have much experience with them.</li>
						<li>To get started, I began working on the AI certification course from Hugging Face to refresh the basics.</li>
						<li>My first big step was joining the "Hacking Agents Hackathon NYC," which introduced me to powerful tools like Langflow and Twelve Labs. I plan to keep using these to develop my project: an AI Fighting Game Coach.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					As a bonus, I also created <a href="https://www.kentalange.com" target="_blank" style="color: var(--color-accent); text-decoration: none;">kentalange.com</a> using Claude for the first time. It was a great opportunity to see how modern LLMs can streamline workflows and boost results.
				</p>
				<p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
					I'm excited to use the knowledge I gained this week. Tech is moving faster than I can learn at school and in some jobs, so I'm going to keep grinding this summer to pull myself up to speed.
